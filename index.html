     <h2>Because words are life</h2>

     <p>
       Writing has become my mouthpiece when words have been too heavy to be poured out from my lips. Till date, it
       is the eyeglass through which I see the world.
       I write to liberate my readers and give others the chance
       to see the world in a different light than what appeals openly to the eye.
       Through writing I hope to become a successful journalist and communications personnel
       who will impact lives through insightful stories and spoken word pieces.
       </p>
       <p> I am an equally active and passionate humanitarian. In association with Touch a Life Impact,
         I have touched the lives of deprived children through contributions in cash and kind as well as spending quality time
         with them
